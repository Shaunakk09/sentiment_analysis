# sentiment_analysis
The goal of this project is to design a software for Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews. In this software project, there will be two categories of users- critics and movie watchers. Critics will be able to visit the website and enter a review for a particular movie. The review that is given will then be analysed and will be categorized according to the sentiment it displays. This review will then be stored according to the sentiment that is analysed from it. This data will be stored in a database server. Movie watchers will be able to access the website to search for and read reviews about particular movies according to their interests, and will also be able to view the rating that has been given for that particular movie according to the reviews and the sentiments that have been analysed from them. Critics will also be able to view the reviews.
